# manifold-fans-and-critics-extension
Browser extension for Manifold Markets, displaying digital flair on users that hold large positions in permanent markets/stocks.

### TODO
  - Emojis for non-#1 as well?
  - Some convention for reading a fan string from out of the description
  - Does it update even when the user isn't on Manifold? I think so, better do something bout that.
 - hard to mouse from small image onto hover
 - Make sure it looks good in dark mode
 - Test from scratch
 - Solve the disappearing problem on the Positions tab
 - Solve the background script stopping.
 - Test on Chrome
 - Limit ourselves once API gives that capability
 - Smart update (listen for new bets on perm markets, only update the data affected)
