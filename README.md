# manifold-fans-and-critics-extension
Browser extension for Manifold Markets, displaying digital flair on users that hold large positions in permanent markets/stocks.

### TODO
    - Make popup have some style (match manifold colors?)
    - Change "chance" and "probability" to "favorable" or "good". Maybe YES and NO as well?
    - Reduce font size
    - Emojis for non-#1 as well?
    - Some convention for reading a fan string from out of the description
    - It still just sometimes doesn't show on the page, then I refresh and it shows.
    - I'm probably still doing storage horribly wrong.
    - Does our storage get erased every time the browser closes, or is that just because it's loaded as a temporary extension?
    - hard to mouse from small image onto hover
    - Make sure it looks good in dark mode
    - Test from scratch
    - Solve the disappearing problem on the Positions tab
    - Solve the background script stopping.
    - Test on Chrome
    - Limit ourselves once API gives that capability
    - Smart update (listen for new bets on perm markets, only update the data affected)
